There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading

> Gutendocs - We build your API so you can get back to coding

## Sub-Heading

> Whether you are a startup who can't commit the resources to write an API or a massive company with too much going on to make sure the API is up to date gutendocs is here for you.  Just make sure your JSDocs are up to date when you update code and your API will always be accurate.

## Summary

> Having an out of data API, or needing to step away from coding to format something to be nice to read is not an ideal situation for anyone involved.  You have much better things to be doing than writing up an attractive format to explain how your code works.  So we have automated that process for you.

## Problem

> APIs are an important part of any codebase, and it can be expensive to keep the API update, either financially or braincycles.

## Solution

> Gutendocs will ask you to set up some basic design principals for how you want your API to look, and then as long as you are following good coding practice with your JDDoc comments you wil always have an API.

## How to Get Started

> Just run `gutendocs parse --all` in your repos root, and you are done.

## Customer Quote

> "I never thought setting up an API for our company could be so easy"

## Closing and Call to Action

> Install gutendocs today with `npm install -g gutendocs` and get started today!
